### three different types of machine learning  
P 27  
- supervised learning  
    + supervised: a set of samples where the desired output signals (labels) are already known  
    + classification:  
        * predict the categorical class labels of new instances based on past observations  
        * learn a model from labeled training data --> allows to make predictions about unseen or future data  
    + regression:  
        * the outcome signal: a continuous value  
        * given a number of predictor (explanatory) variables and a continuous response variable (outcome), and we try to find a relationship between those variables that allows us to predict an outcome  
- unsupervised learning  
    + dealing with unlabeled data or data of unknown structure  
        * explore the structure of data --> discovering hidden structures  
        * extract meaningful information without the guidance of a known outcome variable or reward function  
    + clustering: organize a pile of information into meaningful subgroups (clusters) without having any prior knowledge of their group memberships  
    + dimensionality reduction:  
        * commonly used approach in feature preprocessing to remove noise from data  
        * degrade the predictive performance of certain algorithms, and compress the data onto a smaller dimensional subspace while retaining most of the relevant information  
        * for data visualization  
- reinforcement learning  
    + goal: develop a system (agent) that improves its performance based on interactions with the environment --> solving interactive problems  
    + maximizes the **_reward_** via an exploratory trial-and-error approach or deliberative planning  
        * reward signal: not the correct ground truth label or value, but a measure of **how well the action was measured** by a reward function
